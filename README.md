# CheatDeviceRemastered - UserScripts

A collection of UserScripts made for [CheatDeviceRemastered](http://cheatdeviceremastered.com/ "Official Website").

These Scripts can be added to CDR by creating .txt files in ms0:/CDR/SCRIPTS/LCS (GTA LCS) and /VCS (GTA VCS) directories on the **Memory Card**.

To download them from GitHub, simply clone the repository or download the ZIP file.

Those can be acessed inside CDR by going to "UserScripts".

These script text files follow Sanny Builder 3's syntax and require opcodes for each instruction. 
Cleo "IF", "THEN" and "END" syntax is NOT supported! Therefore it's recommended to enable "Write Opcodes" under "Tools > Options > General" in Sanny Builder, if you plan to copy paste from decompiled SCMs.

If you want to create your own **UserScripts**, there's a tutorial on the Wiki (still not finished by now)!

Have fun with it!

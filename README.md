# CheatDeviceRemastered - UserScripts
A collection of UserScripts for use with [CheatDeviceRemastered](http://cheatdeviceremastered.com/ "Official Website")

Scripts can be added to CheatDevice Remastered by creating text files in the /CDR/SCRIPTS/LCS and /VCS directories on the memory card.

These script text files follow Sanny Builder 3's syntax and require opcodes for each instruction. Cleo IF THEN END syntax is NOT supported! Therefore it is recommended to enable "Write Opcodes" under "Tools > Options > General" if you plan to copy paste from decompiled SCMs.
